#Change Log
Script files I wrote code in:
	-Events.cs - for game events
		-attached to the Vehicle Controller prefab, which contains the player controlled car
		-entirely my script
	-RealTimeTrack.cs 
		(TrackGen – A Procedural Track Generator by Marcus Vinicius da Silva)
		-generates the entire environment besides a few game objects at start (4 torches, 2 			 zombies, 1 box collider, 1 vehicle)
		-the generation of the track in this script is not my work
		-the generation of the public GameObjects in this script is my work
	-CarController.cs 
		(Standard Assets by Unity)
		-this script is not my work
		-only added code to save current speed into PlayerPrefs
		

Issues Before:
	-car does not get destroyed upon death and exists for a 3 second duration before returning to 		 the start screen
	-endless falling if you back up off the track at the start
	-coins give inconsistent number of points
	-[critical bug] obstacle generation y location is incorrect, maybe due to track slope
	-[critical bug] obstacle generation x location does not work correctly at some ranges 
	 of track, somehow due to the track generation implementation
	-no coin collection (only one point system for score existed)

Game Design Goals:
	-powerups (partially implemented)
	-two score systems (to be usable in a store):
		zombie count system
		coin count system 
	-store (partially implemented)
		-related components are existant - UI button location, currency (coins and zombies)
	-obstacle for instant death
	-collect currency personally for player

Fixed Issues:
	-car now gets destroyed upon death
	-falling off the track by backing up at the start will now result in death
	-coins give a consistent number of points
		-first tried OnTriggerExit, but coins did not immediately disappear
		-resolved using a boolean in Update() to identify when a coin is triggering, which is to
		 stop incrementing the score after the one necessary increment occurs

New:
	-two assets - Hand Painted Bottle, and Road Blocker
	-spawning locations of coins
		-coin x positions are next to each other (not totally random)
		-randomly disrupts a fluid line of coins to start a new line of coins
		 at a new random x position
	-[removed] added dust particles generation
		-turned off the generation
		-the algorithm spawned a new GameObject at random places along the track
		-this gave bad performance, should implement by making them spawn relative to the car
	-added sandswirls generation beside the track
		-rotation is set to be the same as the adjacent track piece rotation
		-sand doesn't travel in its GameObject set rotation, and instead moves in the same global 		direction
	-made each spawn frequency GameObject public, so their value can be changed in Unity
	-added flash upon track piece spawn
		-can't be seen at distance
	-counts number of hit zombies
		-this is intended for achievements or currency
	-added speed value, displaying with score and zombie count for now
	-added new barrier obstacle, deals 10dmg when hit at a speed < 35KPH, death otherwise
	-added count for coins
	-added powerups (no active use yet)

Polished:
	-lowered frequency of barrels
	-better spawning location of torches
		-spawns at an edge of the track
	-increased field of view
	-moved UI from top to below the car

Existing Issues/Improvements:
	-[critical bug] obstacle generation y location is incorrect, maybe due to track slope
	-[critical bug] obstacle generation x location does not work correctly at some ranges 
	 of track, maybe due to the track generation asset
	-an efficient algorithm needs to be developed for spawning particle systems; to avoid 	 		 performance issues
	-if by chance you are launched into the air by a collision:
		-the camera view is horrendous
		-you may fall too far from the track to hit intended colliders, and fall infinitely
	-possible to get stuck on the edge of the track
	-add: track has a lifetime, and falling off for being too slow should result in 		         	 	death
		-forces player to achieve store items (better powerups/vehicles) to survive on track 			longer
	-[important] improve UI (ex. Speedometer)
